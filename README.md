# Product Case Studies

A collection of product case studies built while learning and practicing
product thinking across strategy, growth, and AI-driven workflows.

This repository documents how I approach real-world product problems —
from identifying user pain points to proposing structured, data-backed
solutions.

## What This Repository Contains
Each case study typically covers:
- Problem identification & context
- User pain points and assumptions
- Market or competitor analysis
- Product goals and success metrics
- Solution design and prioritization
- Trade-offs and decision rationale
- Expected impact and next steps

Some case studies may also include:
- Wireframes or workflow diagrams
- AI-driven product solutions
- Go-to-market or growth considerations

## Why This Repository Exists
Product work is not just about ideas — it’s about structured thinking,
decision-making under uncertainty, and execution clarity.

This repository serves as:
- A learning log for my product journey
- A portfolio of how I break down product problems
- A reference for AI, SaaS, and platform-based product thinking

## Areas of Focus
- Product Strategy & Execution
- Customer Experience & Retention
